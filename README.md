## Description:

`gosh` is a simple Bash bookmark utility that lets you jump between frequently used directories quickly.  
It reduces the stress of traversing long, nested paths or places that you reference often.

It works as a lightweight CLI companion powered by python, with hooks in bash and powershell..

As usual, you are very welcomed to share and hack it, and I would love to hear feedback if you have any.

## Usage:

```
Usage:
  gosh                   (Same as gosh -l)
  gosh <name>            (To change the directory)
  gosh -h | -v           (Show help | version)
  gosh -l | -L           (Show list of bookmarks)
  gosh -p <name>         (Show path for bookmark)
  gosh -e <path>         (Show bookmark for path)
  gosh -a <name> <path>  (Add bookmark)
  gosh -d <name>         (Delete the bookmark)

Options:
  *-h --help     : Show this screen.
  *-v --version  : Show app version and copyright.

  *-e --exists <path>  : Print the Bookmark for path.
  *-p --print  <name>  : Print the path of Bookmark.

  *-l --list       : Show all Bookmarks (no Paths).
  *-L --list-long  : Show all Bookmarks and Paths.

  *-a --add    <name> <path>  : Add a Bookmark with specified path.
  *-r --delete <name>         : Delete a Bookmark.

Notes:
  If <path> is blank the current directory is assumed.

  Options marked with * are exclusive, i.e. gosh will run that
  and exit after the operation.
